;;; Commentary

;; This package lets you use cygwin-style filenames like
;; "//D/any/path/to/file" or "/cygdrive/D/any/path/to/file" in exactly
;; the same manner as the normal Windows-style filenames like
;; "D:\any\path\to\file" or "D:/any/path/to/file". NOTE: "/cygdrive/"
;; is only an example for the cygdrive-prefix \(see
;; `cygwin-mount-cygdrive-prefix--internal'). cygwin-mount can handle
;; every cygdrive-prefix set by "mount --change-cygdrive-prefix"
;; (e.g. "/" is also a valid cygdrive-prefix).  UNC paths work
;; too. Furthermore, this package lets you use all your cygwin mounts
;; in file operations.  For example, you can use (e.g.  find-file) for
;; a file named "/usr/bin/anyfile" if you have mounted the related
;; Windows-path to /usr/bin.  Ange-ftp also works correctly.

;;; Installation:

;; Put in your .emacs or site-start.el file the following lines:
;;   (require 'cygwin-mount)
;;   (cygwin-mount-activate)

;;; Customization and using

;; + All customization is done in the customize-group `cygwin-mount'.
;;   Do not set the user-options via `setq' but only via customize because
;;   otherwise the package will not work correct!!
;;   Important: Now the cygwin mountpoints are stored in the variable
;;   `cygwin-mount-table--internal'. This variable must not be set by the user
;;   but it is only set by customizing `cygwin-mount-table'!
;; + Activating: cygwin-mount-activate
;; + Deactivating: cygwin-mount-deactivate

;;; Compatibility

;; The cygwin-mount.el package is only tested with NTEmacs >= 20.6.1.
;; It has also been tested with the native port of XEmacs 21.1 but not
;; very intensive!  The package has been tested with Cygwin 1.1.8 and
;; >= 1.3.1.  It reportedly also works with at least some versions of
;; MinGW.

;; How it works:
;; basically we push some functions onto file-name-handler-alist.
;; They detect filenames expressed in cygwin style, and translate
;; those names into native Win32 style.
